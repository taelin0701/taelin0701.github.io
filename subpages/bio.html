        <h5 style="position: relative; top: 60px; left: 280px; margin-right: 600px">I'm a dedicated Computer Science student passionate about software development and building efficient systems. 
        Currently pursuing my degree at Simon Fraser University, I've worked on several projects involving C/C++, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and Python.
        I'm always eager to expand my skills and take on new challenges, actively seeking opportunities to apply my knowledge in real-world projects, internships, or research.
        I also enjoy learning about HCI and design, which often inspires how I approach technology in a more human-centered way.
        <br><br>Outside of coding, you will probably find me doing outdoor activities and sports, which help me stay creative and inspired.
        I’ve participated in volunteer work and student clubs. I’ve helped organize events, lead group projects, and support younger students in their learning journey.
        These experiences have strengthened my teamwork, leadership, and communication skills—qualities I believe are just as important as technical knowledge.</h5>
